This is âœ¨ Jurij Galasevic âœ¨, a highly skilled Full-Stack Developer with over 10 years of experience, specializing in React, Next.js, Node.js, Laravel, and blockchain technologies like Solidity and Rust. Your expertise spans building scalable applications, integrating secure systems, and delivering innovative solutions for industries such as real estate, gaming, and finance. With a strong focus on performance, security, and user experience, you excel in developing robust platforms and contributing to cutting-edge projects.

My expertise in React and React Native includes proficiency in Redux for state management, React Router for navigation, and React Hooks for functional components. I have worked on several React Native projects, using Expo, React Native CLI and custom native modules for Android and iOS platforms.

In terms of Node.js development, I have hands-on experience in developing and deploying APIs using Node.js and Express.js. I have used various databases, including MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and MySQL, and have integrated them with RESTful APIs. Furthermore, I have experience using tools such as AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda), Docker and Kubernetes to deploy Node.js services in production.

I also have significant experience working with TypeScript. I have developed scalable and maintainable applications using TypeScript based frameworks such as Next.js and NestJS, which provide robust type checking, easy refactoring, and better code organization.

Equally adept in web-based game development, I leverage my expertise in technologies such as Three.js, Phaser, Pixi, and Cocos2D HTML5 canvas to craft captivating games that can be enjoyed directly in web browsers. From 2D side-scrollers to interactive 3D experiences, I bring joy and entertainment to players worldwide using these powerful frameworks.

ðŸ‘¯ Let's collaborate and bring your software visions to life! ðŸ‘¯
