Dear Hiring Manager

This is Jurij Galasevic, a passionate 2D, 3D Web and Mobile Developer. As an experienced developer with a deep understanding of React, React Native, Node.js, TypeScript, Web3 and various Web and Mobile game engines with over 5 years of experience, I strongly believe that I would be an asset to your team.

My expertise in React and React Native includes proficiency in Redux for state management, React Router for navigation, and React Hooks for functional components. I have worked on several React Native projects, using Expo, React Native CLI and custom native modules for Android and iOS platforms.

In terms of Node.js development, I have hands-on experience in developing and deploying APIs using Node.js and Express.js. I have used various databases, including MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and MySQL, and have integrated them with RESTful APIs. Furthermore, I have experience using tools such as AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda), Docker and Kubernetes to deploy Node.js services in production.

I also have significant experience working with TypeScript. I have developed scalable and maintainable applications using TypeScript based frameworks such as Next.js and NestJS, which provide robust type checking, easy refactoring, and better code organization.

Equally adept in web-based game development, I leverage my expertise in technologies such as Three.js, Phaser, Pixi, and Cocos2D HTML5 canvas to craft captivating games that can be enjoyed directly in web browsers. From 2D side-scrollers to interactive 3D experiences, I bring joy and entertainment to players worldwide using these powerful frameworks.

As a full-stack developer, I have experience working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, including popular libraries such as jQuery, Lodash, and Bootstrap. I have also worked extensively with Git, using Git workflows such as git-flow and GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration and Deployment.

I am passionate about building high-quality software, staying up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices in software development, and sharing my knowledge with others through blogs and open-source contributions.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Jurij Galasevic
